        <h1><strong>Vehicle</strong></h1>
        <p>
            A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum <sup style="color: blue;">[1]</sup>) is a machine that 
            transports people or cargo. Vehicles include wagons, 
            bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, 
            buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft 
            (ships, boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled 
            vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) 
            and spacecraft.<sup style="color: blue;">[2]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to 
            apply steering and drive forces against the ground: wheeled, 
            tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also 
            internationally used in legislation, for road vehicles types, 
            terms and definitions.<sup style="color: blue;">[3]</sup>
