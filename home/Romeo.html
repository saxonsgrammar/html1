                Prologue
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Two households, both alike in dignity
            <br>
            (In fair Verona, where we lay our scene),
            <br>
            From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
            <br>
            Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
            <br>
            From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
            <br>
            A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life;
            <br>
            Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
            <br>
            Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.
            <br>
            The fearful passage of their death-marked love
            <br>
            And the continuance of their parents’ rage,
            <br>
            Which, but their children’s end, naught could remove,
            <br>
            Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;
            <br>
            The which, if you with patient ears attend,
            <br>
            What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

            No, for then we should be colliers.
